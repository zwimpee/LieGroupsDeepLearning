# Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations - A Computation-Backed Walkthrough

This project aims to provide a computational walkthrough of the graduate-level textbook "Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations" by Peter J. Olver. We aim to supplement the theoretical content of the book with Python code, using libraries like PyTorch and Matplotlib, to provide a more interactive and hands-on learning experience.

## Overview

Lie groups and their applications to differential equations are a fundamental part of modern mathematics and physics. _The underlying algebraic structure of Lie groups_ has the potential for significant implications in various areas of artificial intelligence, including the development of neural networks.

## Content

The content is organized chapter by chapter, following the structure of the textbook. For each chapter, we provide:

- A summary of the key concepts and definitions
- Python code to illustrate these concepts with concrete examples and visualizations
- Exercises to test your understanding and provide additional practice

_Within the field of neural networks_, Lie groups are an area of ongoing research and exploration. Researchers are actively investigating the potential of Lie group representations and transformations in enhancing the capabilities of neural networks, particularly in deep learning and sequential data processing tasks. This includes exploring the use of Lie group representations in architectures like Transformers and investigating novel techniques such as Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCN).

## Requirements

To run the Python code, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
