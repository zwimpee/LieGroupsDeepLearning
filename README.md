# Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations - A Computation-Backed Walkthrough

This project aims to provide a computational walkthrough of the graduate-level textbook "Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations" by Peter J. Olver. We aim to supplement the theoretical content of the book with Python code, using libraries like PyTorch and Matplotlib, to provide a more interactive and hands-on learning experience.

## Overview

Lie groups and their applications to differential equations are a fundamental part of modern mathematics and physics. _The underlying algebraic structure of Lie groups_ has the potential for significant implications in various areas of artificial intelligence, including the development of neural networks.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Lie Groups

In Chapter 1, "Introduction to Lie Groups," we explore the foundational concepts of Lie groups and their relation to smooth manifolds. The chapter begins with the quote from Peter J. Olver's textbook:

> "*...Once we have freed ourselves from this dependence on coordinates, it is a small step to the general definition of a smooth manifold.*" - Olver, pg. 3

We start by understanding the definition of a smooth manifold, which serves as the basis for comprehending Lie groups. The definition is as follows:

### **Definition 1.1** - **$M$-Dimensional Manifold**
An **$m$-dimensional manifold** is a set **$M$**, together with a countable collection of subsets **$U_{\alpha} \subset M$**, called ***coordinate charts***, and one-to-one functions **$\chi_\alpha \colon U_\alpha \mapsto V_\alpha$** onto connected open subsets **$V_{\alpha}\subset \mathbb{R}^m$**, called ***local coordinate maps***, which satisfy the following properties:

*a)* The ***coordinate charts*** *cover* **$M$**:
$$\bigcup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha} = M$$

*b)* On the overlap of any pair of coordinate charts, $U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta}$, the composite map
$$
\chi_{\beta}\circ \chi_{\alpha}^{-1}\colon \chi_{\alpha}(
    U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta}
) \mapsto \chi_{\beta}(
    U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta}
)
$$

is a smooth (***infinitely differentiable***) function.

*c)* If $x \in U_{\alpha}$ and $\tilde x \in U_{\beta}$ are distinct points of **$M$**, then there exist open subsets $W\subset V_{\alpha}$, $\tilde W \subset V_{\beta}$ with $\chi_{\alpha}(x)\in W$, $\chi_{\beta}(\tilde x)\in \tilde W$, satisfying
$$
\chi_{\alpha}^{-1}(W)\cap\chi_{\beta}^{-1}(\tilde W) = \emptyset
$$

> #### ***Notes***
>
> *The local coordinate charts $\chi_{\alpha}\colon U_{\alpha} \mapsto V_{\alpha}$ endow the manifold $M$ with the structure of a topological space. Namely, we require that for each open subset $W\subset V_{\alpha}\subset\mathbb{R}^{m}$, $\chi_{\alpha}^{-1}(W)$ be an open subset of $M$. These sets form a *basis* for the topology on $M$, so that $U \subset M$ is open if and only if for each $x \in U$ there is a neighborhood of $x$ of the above form contained in $U$; i.e., $x \in \chi_{\alpha}^{-1}(W) \subset U$, where $\chi_{\alpha}\colon U_{\alpha} \mapsto V_{\alpha}$ is a coordinate chart containing $x$, and $W$ is an open subset of $V_{\alpha}$. In terms of this topology, the third requirement in the definition of a manifold is just a statement of the Hausdorff separation axiom. The degree of differentiability of the overlap functions $\chi_{\beta} \circ \chi_{\alpha}^{-1}$ determines the degree of smoothness of the manifold.*

## Content

The content is organized chapter by chapter, following the structure of the textbook. For each chapter, we provide:

- A summary of the key concepts and definitions
- Python code to illustrate these concepts with concrete examples and visualizations
- Exercises to test your understanding and provide additional practice

Within the field of neural networks, Lie groups are an area of ongoing research and exploration. Researchers are actively investigating the potential of Lie group representations and transformations in enhancing the capabilities of neural networks, particularly in deep learning and sequential data processing tasks. This includes exploring the use of Lie group representations in architectures like Transformers and investigating novel techniques such as Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCN).

## Requirements

To run the Python code, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
